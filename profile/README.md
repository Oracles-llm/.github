# Oracle

We are final year computer science & engineering undergraduate students at University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. 
We are currently experimenting a lightweight model that can completely run in local machines.

## 🚀 What We Are Building

### ⚡ Local-First Lightweight LLMs

Models designed to run on everyday hardware such as laptops, desktops, mobile devices while still achieving strong instruction-following and reasoning capabilities.

### 🧠 Dynamic Knowledge Integration

We combine small reasoning models with an intelligent retrieval system and curated domain knowledge bases.
This gives lightweight models **superpowers** normally found only in larger LLMs.

### 🔒 Privacy-Preserving AI

All inference, storage, and retrieval happen locally.
No data is uploaded, logged, or shared—ever.
