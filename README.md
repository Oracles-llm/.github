# GitHub Issue Templates for Our Organization

This repository holds **common GitHub issue templates** for all repositories in our organization.

## Purpose

- Ensure consistency for bug reports, feature requests, and tasks/discussions.
- Save time by using a standard format for all repositories.
- Facilitate clearer communication and tracking for contributors.

## Usage

- Any repository in this organization that **does not have its own issue templates** will automatically inherit these templates.
- Templates included:
  1. Bug Report
  2. Feature Request
  3. Task / Discussion

> Note: To override these templates in a specific repository, add a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder in that repository with its own templates. 

> **🚨 IMPORTANT**
> Before opening or modifying issues that could affect repository configuration or workflows, contact an **ADMIN** first.  
> If unsure whether a change is safe, wait for ADMIN approval.

> **⚠️ CAUTION**
> Do not close, rename, or delete files, labels, workflows, or issue templates without prior approval from an **ADMIN** — unauthorized changes can disrupt CI/CD, automation, or organization-wide settings.
