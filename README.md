  2. Feature Request
  3. Task / Discussion

> Note: To override these templates in a specific repository, add a `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` folder in that repository with its own templates.

> Before opening or modifying issues that could affect repository configuration or workflows, contact an **ADMIN** first. If unsure whether a change is safe, wait for **ADMIN** approval.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not close, rename, or delete files, labels, workflows, or issue templates without prior approval from an **ADMIN** unauthorized changes can disrupt CI/CD, automation, or organization-wide settings.
